# LLaVA: Large Language and Vision Assistant

## Overview

LLaVA (Large Language and Vision Assistant) is an open-source multimodal conversational model designed to combine the natural language capabilities of large language models with image understanding. This repository provides a tutorial and code implementation for creating a vision chat assistant using the LLaVA model.

## Introduction

Large Language Models have proven revolutionary, and their applications continue to grow. LLaVA extends their capabilities by integrating vision, allowing the model to assist with tasks that require both natural language and image understanding. This tutorial guides you through the process of creating a vision chat assistant using the LLaVA model, promoting transparency and accessibility in experimentation.

## LLaVA Model

The LLaVA model extracts visual embeddings from images and treats them like language tokens, enhancing language models with vision capabilities. Leveraging a pre-trained CLIP visual encoder and a vision-language connector, LLaVA aligns visual and text embeddings through two stages of training: pre-training for feature alignment and fine-tuning with visual instructions. Notably, only the lightweight vision-language connector is learned from scratch.

## Getting Started

Creating a vision chatbot using the provided code is straightforward. The repository includes standardized chat templates for proper input parsing, ensuring the quality of generated answers. The model's lightweight training and fine-tuning process make it accessible for experimentation.

## Limitations

While powerful, LLaVA has limitations. It currently supports only one image per chat, limiting its ability to handle complex conversations with multiple images. Additionally, like other large language models, LLaVA may exhibit hallucinations and susceptibility to tricks with appropriate prompts.

## Conclusion

LLaVA demonstrates impressive vision-language understanding, marking a significant advancement in open-source multimodal models. Its lightweight nature facilitates training and fine-tuning. Adding vision capabilities to chat assistants broadens their applications, enabling them to tackle more complex tasks. The potential for advanced prompting techniques and multimodal outputs opens new avenues for exploration.

## Future Directions

The LLaVA model sets the stage for further innovation. Future directions include addressing limitations, such as supporting multi-image conversations, and exploring additional capabilities, as demonstrated in LLaVA-Interactiveâ€”an all-in-one demo for image chat, segmentation, generation, and editing.

In conclusion, LLaVA represents a crucial step in open-source multimodal generative models, paving the way for diverse and powerful applications. As open-source models become more prevalent, we anticipate a rapid increase in the development of new and impactful use cases.
